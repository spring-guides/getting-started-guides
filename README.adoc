This guide walks you through using VS Code to build one of the Getting Started guides.

== What you'll build

You’ll pick a Spring guide and import it into VS Code. Then you can read the guide, work on the code, and run the project.

== What you'll need

 * About 15 minutes
 * VS Code with Java support
 - If you don’t have VS Code installed yet: {vscode_java_pack}[Coding Pack for Java]
 - If you have VS Code installed already: {vscode_java_ext_pack}[Java Extension Pack]
 * {vscode_spring_ext_pack}[Spring Boot Extension Pack] for VS Code
 * {jdk}[JDK 11] or later

== Installing VS Code with Java and Spring support
Choose and visit above links, and follow instructions to install. When you’re done, go ahead and launch VS Code.

== Cloning a guide project

To work with an existing project you need some code, so clone or copy one of the Getting Started guides, e.g. the REST Service guide:

====
[source,text]
----
git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service.git
----
====

Under the root folder of cloned or copied project, there are `initial` and `complete` folders. The `initial` folder contains initial code set, an empty project, making it possible for you to copy-and-paste your way through a guide. The `complete` folder contains complete code set where all the code from the guide already entered.

== Starting a guide project from initial code set
To start a guide project from initial code set, open the `initial` folder within VS Code. In first open, accept to import the project.

== Opening the complete version of a guide project 

To open the complete version of a guide project, open the `complete` folder within VS Code. In first open, accept to import the project.

== Running a guide

To run, open the source file where main method is defined and click `Run` on editor window.

== Summary

Congratulations! You have setup VS Code, imported the guide to build a RESTful web service, and ran it.
